To keep up with these rapidly changing internet technologies, you may need to brush up your site every 2 to 3 years, depending on your industry. Below are the major things which need to be considered when building your website.</p>

                                In other word, RWD makes your web pages look great on all devices (desktops, tablets, and phones).
                                Due to the number of devices in today's market, RWD represents a fundamental shift in how we’ll build websites for the next decade.

                                <p class="tab-pgraph">According to surveys done by Akamai and Gomez.com, nearly half of web users expect a site to load in 2 seconds or less, and they tend to abandon a site that isn’t loaded within 3 seconds. 79% of web shoppers who have trouble with web site performance say they won’t return to the site to buy again and around 44% of them would tell a friend if they had a poor experience shopping online.
                                This means you’re not just losing conversions from visitors currently on your site, but that loss is magnified to their friends and colleagues as well. The end result – lots of potential sales down the drain because of a few seconds difference.So how do you test and measure your site’s load time while squeezing every drop of performance out of your website?

The same thing happened online.
